        Aryan Bahmanyar is a student at Seneca College, where he is studying Computer Programming &
        Analysis. He made this website about
        <abbr title="Lord of the Rings">LOTR</abbr> for an assignment in his
        <a href="https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/cgi-bin/subject?s1=WEB322">WEB222</a> course.
        Prior to enrolling in the course, Aryan had some experience with HTML and CSS on his own
        time, but he is always striving to learn more and continue to improve. Although Aryan is not
        a professional writer or web developer, he hopes that this website will do the
        <abbr title="Lord of the Rings">LOTR</abbr> franchise justice, and more importantly,
        showcase his knowledge of front-end web development.
