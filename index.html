                            <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>, also known as <abbr title="Lord of the Rings">LOTR</abbr>, follows the treacherous
                            journey of the protagonist, Frodo Baggins, to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron, who is attempting to take over the realm of
                            Middle-earth. To do so, he has to destroy Sauron's source of power, the One Ring, which Frodo has found himself to be in
                            possession of. However, the ring can only be truly destroyed where it was created by Sauron himself; in the fires of
                            Mount Doom, at the heart of Mordor, Sauron's pocket region of Middle-earth. To get to Mount Doom, Frodo has to travel all
                            the way across Middle Earth from his small and quaint village, located in a peaceful region known as the Shire. The
                            fantasy story was initially written as a novel by English author, J.R.R. Tolkien, between 1937 and 1949, and was
                            published between 1954 and 1955. It had become one of the best-selling books of all time, with <a href="#fact-1">over a
                            150 million copies sold.</a> The novel was later divided into the 3 following volumes:

                        <cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> is the first entry in <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> trilogy. The protagonist,
                        Frodo Baggins, begins his journey when he inherits a mysterious and powerful object, known as the One Ring, from his uncle,
                        <a href="#fact-7">Bilbo Baggins.</a> Frodo, upon learning about the antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, and how the ring is
                        his source of power, sets out on a journey to destroy the ring, so that Sauron cannot use it to dominate the realm of
                        Middle-earth, the fictional land where the story takes place in. Frodo sets off from his small village in the Shire, a
                        peaceful region of Middle-earth, along with his cousin, Pippin Took, his loyal gardener, Sam Gamgee, and their friend, Merry
                        Brandybuck. Together, they set off towards a town to meet up with an old friend of Frodo and Bilbo; a wizard known as Gandalf
                        the Grey. In their journey through a forest, the 4 hobbits see mysterious ghoulish men in black garments, riding black
                        horses, known as the Nazg√ªl, the Ringwraiths; they are agents of Sauron looking for the ring. Avoiding detection, the
                        hobbits make it to the village of Bree where Frodo was supposed to meet Gandalf, but they learn that Gandalf hasn't made it.
                        Instead, the hobbits meet a mysterious human character, who goes by the name, Strider. Sauron who is aware of the ring's
                        location due to his connection to it, sends his Ringwraiths to Bree to retrieve it. Strider, who is a friend of Gandalf,
                        saves the hobbits and takes them towards an elven kingdom known as Rivendell. On their way, the Ringwraiths continue to pursue
                        them, but Strider, along with an elven friend of his who meets up with them, manage to fend off the Ringwraiths; but not before
                        Frodo gets injured and passes out. After waking up, Frodo finds himself in Rivendell where he sees both Gandalf and Bilbo
                        again. After Bilbo sets off for good, Frodo is brought to the council of Elrond, the elven king. This is where the fellowship,
                        a group dedicated to helping Frodo destroy the ring, is established. Here, Frodo along with Gandalf and his 3 hobbit friends,
                        is joined by Legolas, an elven archer, Gimli, a dwarf, Boromir, a human warrior who's also an heir to Denethor II, the king
                        of Gondor, and Strider, who is now revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur, an ancient king of Arnor and Gondor. Together,
                        the fellowship sets off, travelling through dangerous snowy mountains in a blizzard, and through ancient dwarven mines, known
                        as the Mines of Moria, while fending off Sauron's demonic foot-soldiers, known as orcs, as well as trolls and other hostile
                        entities along the way. The story concludes in a region of Middle-earth, known as Amon Hen. Here, the fellowship is pursued by
                        a stronger breed of orcs, known as Uruk-hai, who are soldiers of not Sauron, but Saruman, who is a powerful ally of Sauron.
                        Merry and Pippin get taken away, Boromir is killed, and Gandalf was already lost to a demon, known as the Balrog, in the Mines
                        of Moria, or so the fellowship thought. This only left Frodo and Sam who got broken up from the rest of the group and went in
                        their own way, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who went in another direction. The story concludes with the fellowship broken
                        up, setting up the stage for the split groups of protagonists to experience different journeys in the next 2 stories.

                <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
                <p>
                    The second entry in <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> trilogy continues the journey of the protagonists who are now split into
                    3 groups. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor when they encounter Gollum; a disheveled creature who has a destructive
                    obsession with the One Ring. Frodo and Sam do not trust Gollum, but without any sense of direction, they have to trust Gollum to
                    guide them to Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the captured Merry and Pippin, when they come across soldiers of the
                    kingdom of Rohan. They learn about the growing threat of war from Saruman, a powerful ally of Sauron, and attempt to help Rohan
                    prepare for the coming invasion. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin, who have escaped their Uruk-hai captors, have now ran into and got
                    lost in a nearby forest, known as Fangorn Forest. While Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey, Saruman's army marches
                    towards Helm's Deep; a strong and strategic fortress in the kingdom of Rohan. By night, Saruman's forces arrive from Isengard,
                    Saruman's region of Middle-earth, and start to attack Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who are helping Gondor, are also
                    fighting alongside the soldiers to defend the fortress. Meanwhile, in the Fangorn Forest, not too far away from the action at
                    Helm's Deep, Merry and Pippin have encountered strange tree-like creatures, known as Ent. They speak with their leader, and
                    convince him to attack Isengard. By dawn, as the war rages at Helm's Deep, the situation is looking desparate for the defenders.
                    But then, out of nowhere, Gandalf appears with reinforcements and they cahrge at the invaders. With Gandalf's help, the defenders
                    fend off Saruman's army and emerge victorious. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin, along with their new Ent friends are marching towards
                    Isengard and once they arrive, they start to wreak havoc. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, who is now known as Gandalf the
                    White, arrive just in time to see Saruman get killed by one of his own servants who felt mistreated. With the threat of Saruman
                    neutralized, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the others now focus thier concern on Sauron's army. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum get
                    captured by Faramir and his men. Faramir, who is revelead to be Boromir's brother, is also tempted by the ring, just as Boromir
                    was. However, unlike Boromir, Faramir resists his temptation and lets the 3 of them continue on with their journey. As Frodo
                    and Sam get closer to Mordor, they start to see more warning signs from Gollum and his struggles to resist his urges to fight
                    for the ring. The threat of the Ringwraiths, Sauron's ghoulish warriors, also increases as they continue their hunt for Frodo
                    and the ring. The story concludes with Frodo and Sam, as weary as they are, growing more hopeful as they get closer to Mordor.
                    The title of the story refers to the 2 towers, as in the tower of Sauron, Barad-d√ªr, and Orthanc, Saruman's tower, and the
                    alliance between the 2 antagonists.

                <h2>The Return of the King</h2>
                <p>
                    The final entry of <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> continues the journey of the protagonists as they go on with their
                    struggles against the forces of Sauron. Gandalf, along with Pippin, goes to Minas Tirith, the capital city of the kingdom of
                    Gondor, to pay his debt to the king, Denethor II, for Boromir's sacrifice. Boromir, a respected warrior of Gondor, was
                    Denethor II's eldest son, and heir to the throne. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, knowing that Sauron could attack Gondor at any
                    time, go to the Paths of the Dead; an ancient tomb that houses a long dead army, known as and their cursed spirits, known as
                    the Dead Men of Dunharrow. They would not be free of their curse and rest in peace until they fulfilled their oath to fight for
                    Gondor. The trio go there to seek the dead army's help in their fight against the forces of Sauron. The trio weren't successful
                    at first and were met with hostilities from the spirits. However, Aragorn, who was revealed to be the true heir of Isildur, the
                    long-dead king that placed the curse on the now dead army, has authority over the curse. Upon revealing his identity, he
                    convinces the dead army to join him in his fight against Sauron. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue on with their
                    journey. They arrive at a dark city, known as Minas Morgul. The name has a resemblence to Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith,
                    because it was once a city of Gondor, called Minas Ithil. However, it was conquered by Sauron's army long ago, and was renamed
                    to Minas Morgul; the city was corrupted over time. With mountain ranges surrounding Mordor, there are only 2 entry and exit
                    points, one of which is Minas Morgul. The trio, aware of the risks of passing directly through the city, go through a hidden
                    passage around it, using Gollum's knowledge of the area. As they do so, they witness the city's gates open and Sauron's army
                    marching out of it to head towards the capital of Gondor. Then trio then continue their journey through the treacherous
                    mountain passage until Frodo and Sam walk into a the lair of a giant spider, known as Shelob. Gollum, who guided the 2 hobbits
                    into the trap, disappears, leaving Frodo and Sam to confront Shelob. The 2 hobbits fight to defend themselves, but then Shelob
                    bites Frodo, leaving him paralyzed with its venom. Sam continues to fight Shelob, and manages to drive the giant spider away.
                    While Frodo is only paralyzed, Sam believes him to be dying and he carries Frodo, continuing their journey to Mordor. Meanwhile,
                    Sauron's army has arrived at Minas Tirith and they've started to lay siege. A massive battle begins as the Siege of Gondor
                    is initiated. Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf are also participating in the battle to defend the city. On the first
                    day of the siege, the defenders struggle, but keep their ground. The siege continues overnight and by the next day, the invading
                    forces break through the gates, but the defenders do what they can to hold them back. King Th√©oden of Rohan arrives with his
                    army to help Gondor fight back against Sauron's forces. With his cavalry, they charge towards the invading army. However, not
                    long after, king Th√©oden gets killed in the ensuing battle. Aragorn then arrives with the army of the Dead Men and with the
                    combined forces of the 3 armies, they push Sauron's army back and emerge victorious. With their new victory, Aragorn and Gandalf,
                    along with Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and the combined armies of Gondor and Rohan, prepare to march toward Mordor to take
                    the fight to Sauron. As they make their way to Mordor, the orcs prepare a new army to defend Mordor, and among them are Frodo
                    and Sam, who under disguise, sneak through the chaotic crowd of orcs. As they make their way towards Mount Doom, Aragorn's newly
                    assembled army arrives at the gates of Mordor; the main entry and exit point of the land. As the final battle begins, Frodo and
                    Sam make their way up Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring once and for all. When they get close to the entrance that leads to the
                    mouth of the volcano, Gollum appears again, attacking the 2 hobbits in a desparate attempt to take the ring before they destroy
                    it. The hobbits manage to fend off Gollum long enough for Frodo to make it to the mouth of Mount Doom. With a little hesitation,
                    Frodo drops the ring into the lava and Gollum leaps into the air to save the ring. However, the ring and Gollum both fall into
                    the lava and the One Ring, Sauron's source of power, and the object that has tempted and corrupted many individuals, is finally
                    destroyed for good. As a result, Sauron loses all his energy and the tower collapses, and while it does, the ground beneath his
                    army also cracks and collapses, plunging his entire army of orcs into the deep abyss, symbolizing the end of all evil in the

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Since their initial release, both Tolkien's novels and Jackson's movie adaptations have been inspirations for other Lord of
                    the Rings movies and other media, including TV series, such as Amazon's 2022 series, <cite>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of
                    Power</cite>, as well as video games, such as Monolith Production's 2014 game, <cite>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</cite>.
                    Tolkien's work also inspired the popular table-top game, <cite>Dungeons & Dragons</cite>. Tolkien's work not only inspired
                    other works of the high fantasy genre, but the very genre itself. It's no wonder why he's referred to as the "father of fantasy".
                    The <abbr title="Lord of the Rings">LOTR</abbr> franchise has also inspired many talented people to create their own art, both
                    visual and musical. Below are 2 beautiful pieces of music created by one such individual who goes by the name
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@burhanerdemir/featured">Burhan Erdemir</a> on YouTube.
